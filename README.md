# A basic calculator
It takes an infix string, converts it into postfix under the hood and does the mathematical calculation to give you the desired result.

expected character inputs: {, }, [,], (,), 0-9, +, -, *, /, ^

## Use the following infix expression examples to test

(300+23)*(43-21)/(84+7)

(4+8)*(6-5)/((3-2)*(2+2))

25^5/5

### And don't use spaces
