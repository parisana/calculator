# A basic calculator
1. It takes an infix string, converts it into postfix using the Shunting Yard algorithm by Djikstra
2. Does the mathematical calculation on the postfix expression to give you the desired result.

expected character inputs: {, }, [,], (,), 0-9, +, -, *, /, ^

## Use the following infix expression examples to test

(300+23)*(43-21)/(84+7)

(4+8)*(6-5)/((3-2)*(2+2))

25^5/5

### And don't use spaces
